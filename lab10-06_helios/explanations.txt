Q1)
b) The phase of these filters is not linear as they are IIR filters.
-c) Each filter has it's own advantages.So the use of filters depends on the necessity. 
    Magnitude response of butterworth filter decreases monotonically as frquency increases but chebyshev and elliptic show ripples.
    Chebyshev and elliptic have sharper cutoff frequencies whereas the transition band for butterworth filter is larger.
    The time domain output of butterworth filter is more stable compared to chebyshev and elliptic because chebyshev and elliptic have ripples.
 f) The filters work as expected.  
Q2) 
b) Yes, the filter is stable and this can be verified from the pole-zero plot where all poles lie within the unit circle.
c) - On comparing magnitude plots of a and b we can see that magnitude on left and right portions wrt frequency = pi/4 are of different lengths in filter a whereas in case of filter b , the magnitudes are almost same on both left and right of pi/4.
- On comparing the phase plots , we can observe the phase decreases from  90 degrees to -90 in a linear way for filter a whereas in filter b , the phase appears to fall in an exponential manner.
- For the second filter, on varying the value of r we see that the magnitude on left of pi/4 becomes similar to that of magnitude on right. Initially one is high and other low and finally they become almost equal (looks like a straight lint with a drop at pi/4).
