## Question 1
- The given function sin(5*pi*t)+cos(5*pi*t) is sampled and plotted using plot command and step command.
## Question 2
- The quality of reconstruction seems good at the centre region while it detoriates at the ends. Reason can be attributed to the fact that we are just considering few sinc Waves and the sinc waves contributing to the centre region are present while others are missing.
## Question 3
- It's obvious that the signal gets better when the sampling period is increased as more of the signal is captured and the reconstructed signals starts appearing more familiar to the original signal.
- The sinc waves seems to get more dampened and compressed as the sampling period increases.
## Question 4
- The nyquist rate for the given function sin(5*pi*t) is 10pi.when the sampling interval is 0.1 or 0.2 the reconstructed signal is similar  to the original signal becaus ether eis no aliasing  but when the sampling interval is increased further the reconstructed signal is different from the original signal as aliasing occurs and disrupts the signal.
