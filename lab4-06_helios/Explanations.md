# Explanations
## Question 1

- The bit rate of the signal is 128kbps.
- The sampling frequency of the signal is 8000Hz.
- The no.of bits used is 128*10^3/8000=16bits
- It can quantise upto 2^16 levels.
- Aliasing occurs when sampling frequency is decreased.
- High frequencies are noted when sampling frequency is increased.
## Question 2

- We can observe that as the value of L increases , the obtained quantised signals resembles more of the given sinusoid.This is possible as more levels are created as we increase the value of L and hence better approximation of the signal.
- We can observe that when the value of L doubles , the maximum quantisation error gets halved and thus we obtain an decaying exponential shaped graph
