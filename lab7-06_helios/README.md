## Question 1.m
- No input are required for this question.
- This script uses the <strong>roc_cs</strong> function
- Observations are added in explanations file
- When excecuted N,ROC,C,S values will be printed in the command window in order

## Question 2.m


## Question 3.m
- No inputs are required for this question.
- All subquestions are coded up in a single file Q3.m
- (optional) All plots will be displayed when the code is excecuted and some plots(for random R and theta values) are saved in jpeg format in the results folder.
- Few subparts in the code are commented as there were too many figures created. Just uncomment the corresponding subpart which is seperated from others and excecute.
- (optional) Plots for subpart C are in plotted in Polar fashion instead of regular one for better intuition.
- Observations are added in explanations file

## Question 4.m
