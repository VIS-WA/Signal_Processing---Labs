# Lab2

<strong>File Names:</strong>
- Codes are named in Format Qx_y where x is question number and y is the subquestion alphabet(s).
- All the functions are named as given in the handout.

<strong>Input/Output:</strong>

Q2_bcdef : This prog doesn;t require any inputs and it output various plots mentioned in the questions.The plots are printed as mentioned in the question and is saved in the Results folder.

<strong> Explanations for theory questions: </strong>

- Q2_a : The output signal y(t) is also a periodic signal and has fourier coefficeients as akùêª(kùúîo), where ak 's are the FS coefficients of given periodic signal x(t).The periodicity of y(t) is same as that of x(t).
- Q2_b : A will be a vector where a-1=a1 and ak=0 for all k!=-1,1.
- Q2_c : Frequency corresponding to an ak will be kwo.
- Q2_d : For wc=0.5 the frequencies -1 and 1 will be filtered and we get a zero output
- Q2_e : For wc=0.5 the frequencies -1 and 1 will not  and we get the same cos(t) graph as output.
- Q2_f : In the output signal we obtain , we can obeserve that there's phase shift and amplitude scaling.This can be attrbuted to the fact that in the given purely cos function , a sine term is getting introduced.Also for a= 1/RC , G=a, This filter is equal to that of a RC filter.
