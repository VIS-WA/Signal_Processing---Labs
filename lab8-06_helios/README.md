## Question 1.m


## Question 2.m
- No inputs are required.
- All the subparts are coded into single file Q2.m
- The plots are added in the results folder
- The observations are added into the explantions text file
- All labelings are done appropriately.

## Question 3.m
- No inputs are required for this question.
- All subquestions are coded up in a single file Q3.m
- subparts in the code are commented as there were too many figures created. Just uncomment the corresponding subpart which is seperated from others and excecute.
- the last subpart is uncommented which actually gives output when inbuilt FFT function is used. Also plot is displayed.For this 'Check Function' to work, only one subpart should be uncommented at a time and excecuted, else the check function only displays the graph for the last uncommented function.
- Seperate function file <strong> directdft.m </strong> is included, which requires only the input vector to be computed .
- Values less than near e ^ (-10) are considered 0 as if not considered, we were getting random phase plots with unexplained behaviour.This consideration worked fine except for cos(w0.(N-1)). The phase should be 0 there but it's showing the values of order exp(-16) which can be considered 0.
- The plots are added in the results folder.
- Observations are added in explanations file.
- All labelings are done appropriately.

## Question 4.m
- No inputs are required
- It is added in the codes foolder under the name Q4.m
- The plots are added in results folder.
- A semilog graph was also included for better intuition.
- We've taken n values in the range of (0,2000).
- The observations are added into explantions file.
- All labelings are done appropriately.
